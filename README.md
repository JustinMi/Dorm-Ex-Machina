# Dorm-Ex-Machina
Won first place at Robotics@Berkeley's 2016 invention competition.

# Introduction
Students hate being locked out at college dorms--it is a time-consuming and inconvenient process to get back into their room, especially if roommates and RAs are not immediately available.

This project aims to be the solution to forgetful roommates by warning them when they are about to get locked out, while also serving as a convenient hub for assistance if they get locked out anyways.

# Project Details
Uses an Arduino microcontroller with multiple sensors, including a motion sensor, a magnetic door sensor and an RFID chip reader. In addition, the system is linked with a user's phone using a Bluetooth module and an Android app. 

# Operation
How the system works, in general:

1. The RFID and Bluetooth technology is used to sense when a user is about to leave the room without their key--the system is able to differentiate between different owners of different keys, as well as differentiate between people entering and leaving the room. 

2. If the user is about to leave the room without their keys, the system beeps a friendly reminder

3. If the user still forgets their keys, they get a notification on their phone. They then can use the Android app as a hub to quickly contact their roommates, RAs, etc.
